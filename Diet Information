The platypus is a carnivore: it feeds on annelid worms, insect larvae, freshwater shrimp, and freshwater yabby that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It uses cheek-pouches to carry prey to the surface, where it is eaten.The platypus needs to eat about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food.
